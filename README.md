# Nuclear Reactor Analysis - Power BI
[Power BI link](https://app.powerbi.com/links/dbK-xRd6Et?ctid=34b14805-261a-4b4f-996f-842e8a731db2&pbi_source=linkShare&bookmarkGuid=d3e605d1-68af-47d8-8df5-ab91d22f3c0c)
## Introduction
### Background
- This nuclear reactor analysis is part of a 4 part learning journey so I can effictively learn top programs used by data analysts. This section mainly focuses on visualization and presentation of data through graphs and statistics. I pinpoint certain metrics to get a good picture of the nuclear reactor landscape by using Power BI as a tool for storytelling and insights. I chose nuclear power as a subject because it's extremly intriguing and I believe that it's the future of energy that most countries will adopt. I will show key metrics through recent years to back up my claim.  
### Goals
1. Understand the nuclear reactor types and occurance
2. Uncover common reactor models
3. Find out where this reactors are located
4. Understand the past nuclear energy to look forward to the future. 
### Plan
- I will import all the data from the IAEA from my postgreSQL server database.
- Use various visualizations from Power BI to see the data.
- Interpret the data based on the tools used in Power BI and draw conclusions.

#### Graphs and Data

- Slicers that allow multiple variables to be manipulated giving options such as 'all', 'operational', and 'shutdown' reactors; desired year(s) or country(s)

- Quick facts about the whole nuclear reactor landscape or desired changes as listed in the slicers above. Shows how many total reactors, the count of unique reactor types, net and median energy output in Mega Watts Electrical (MWE).

- More general facts about where the majority of nuclear reactors are distributed by country,  the count by each reactor type, how much energy each country outputs currently, and how much energy each reactor type outputs on average.

- Two line graphs to visualize the energy added each year and the reactor types added each year since 1954 for all reactors or 1969 for current operational reactors.

#### Intrepetation
- There are 412 active nuclear reactors and 209 deactivated reactors.
- 7 unique operational reactor types and 11 accounting for the shutdown reactors.
- 370K MWE of energy output and 105k MWE equivalent energy shutdown.
- Median energy output for all operational reactors is 950MWE per reactor.
- The USA, France and China have the most current nuclear reactors and total energy output.
- Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) are the most common type.
- Boiling Water Reactors seem to be the most effiecent type of reactor.
- In 1985, we saw the most energy added in nuclear energy along with PWR addition.
